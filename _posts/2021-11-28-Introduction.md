My name is Pranshu Kumar Agrawal and I am engineering student [(my resume)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NkrDR9qZfo4daCGQzcZVY-vlenh4BLp_/view?usp=sharing).

I am from India and my hobby is learning new things bith tech and non-tech each and everyday.

I am great follower of Steve Jobs & Elon Musk (as I have read books on them) and I look to add value in one way or other in this universe before departing.


Currently I am learning DevOps and looking to contribute to opensource as much as possible.

## Why this Blog?

As I am learning DevOps I found that there is no guide in the internet on how to make it big in DevOps.
I mean there are roadmaps but nobody is saying out loud that these roadmaps helped them. So I thought of trying to follow the roadmap and document where ever it takes me.




### Note
As this is my first blog I don't know much about it. I will be learning and implementing bascially everything so forgive me for errors and lack of features in my blog posts.
