So I was searching for a begineer friendly project to contribute to but then I found out that the bigger the project you are trying to contribute to the better you will learn from the community involved in it.

I came accross this website [(link)](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) and was encouraged after going through it.

Then I started to look for some of the cooler projects to contribute to on Google and came across [this](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/open-source-repositories-github/)
