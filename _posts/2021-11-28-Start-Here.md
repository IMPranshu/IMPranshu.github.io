## Valuable Resources

These are some of the resources that intriuged me in starting a carrer in DevOps.


[Get 40+ LPA Base Package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r40DtAzZvcY)

Now frankly speaking my motivation was not just the money but also is that I don't like competetive programming. I love DS and Algos but I have tried my hands on CP but it didn't interest me that much.
I always wanted to do development work and finding about opensource contributions and properly using github as a Social Media on steriods([check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE&t=1933s)) grabbed my attention and I started my journey altogether from scratch alone.


I searched the internet for a complete guide or a Hands-On playlist(free ofcourse) but was in no luck. Then I saw an opporunity that if there is noone doing this why not dive in and become the first to do this(i know it sounds silly but...) and started this blog.
